Java Variables

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

Declaring (Creating) Variables
To create a variable in Java, you need to:

Choose a type (like int or String)
Give the variable a name (like x, age, or name)
Optionally assign it a value using =

Syntax
type variableName = value;
