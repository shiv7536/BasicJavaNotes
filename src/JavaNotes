Definition of Java Variables (short and clear):
A variable in Java is a named memory location used to store data that can be changed during program execution.

Java data types
Java data types define the type of data a variable can hold, such as numbers, characters, or logical values.

Tpypes of data types in Java:
primitive Data Types: Primitive data types are the basic built-in types in Java that store simple values like numbers, characters, or booleans.
non-primitive Data Types: Non-primitive data types are user-defined or complex types that store objects or collections of data.

Introduction of var Keyword:
The var keyword in Java (introduced in Java 10) is used for local variable type inference — it lets the compiler automatically determine the variable’s 
data type based on the assigned value.

var name = "Shiv";   // compiler infers String
var age = 25;        // compiler infers int

Uses:


Reduces code length and improves readability.
Useful when the type is obvious or too long to write.
Can only be used for local variables (inside methods).
