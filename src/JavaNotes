Definition of Java Variables (short and clear):
A variable in Java is a named memory location used to store data that can be changed during program execution.

Java data types
Java data types define the type of data a variable can hold, such as numbers, characters, or logical values.

Tpypes of data types in Java:
primitive Data Types: Primitive data types are the basic built-in types in Java that store simple values like numbers, characters, or booleans.
non-primitive Data Types: Non-primitive data types are user-defined or complex types that store objects or collections of data.

Introduction of var Keyword:
The var keyword in Java (introduced in Java 10) is used for local variable type inference — it lets the compiler automatically determine the variable’s 
data type based on the assigned value.

var name = "Shiv";   // compiler infers String
var age = 25;        // compiler infers int

Uses:


Reduces code length and improves readability.
Useful when the type is obvious or too long to write.
Can only be used for local variables (inside methods).


Java Operators
Operators in Java are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.
Types of Operators in Java:
Arithmetic Operators – perform mathematical operations.
👉 +, -, *, /, %

Relational Operators – compare two values.
👉 ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Logical Operators – combine multiple conditions.
👉 &&, ||, !

Assignment Operators – assign values to variables.
👉 =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

Unary Operators – operate on a single operand.
👉 ++, --, +, -, !

Bitwise Operators – perform bit-level operations.
👉 &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>

Ternary Operator – shorthand for if-else.
👉 condition ? value1 : value2

Instanceof Operator – checks object type.
👉 obj instanceof ClassName
